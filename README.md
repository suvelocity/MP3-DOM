Welcome to my MP3 player!

explanatin about what's going on in this repo.
I started to work on this project at the beggining of the first assinment of DOM.
I wanted to continue it in my own way, this is why its not following the given tamplate.
Also I splited the function between the js files including my logic, while im designing my style as a programmer.
Functions that work with the Player object are in `player.js` with the object.
Function that works with the DOM and the event listeners and so on are in `index.js`.
Hope you will appreciate my way and decisions as a programer.
